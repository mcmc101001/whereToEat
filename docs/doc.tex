\section{Introduction}
I decided to use LaTeX instead of markdown to generate the documentation to brush up on my LaTeX skill.

\section{Tech}
\subsection{Backend}
For the backend, I used FastAPI as the main framework, with Pydantic as the data validation library.

\subsection{Frontend}
For the frontend, I used Vue.js as the main framework, with TailwindCSS for styling.

\section{Deployment}
I used Docker to containerize the FastAPI backend, and deployed it on DigitalOcean. I spent lots of time trying to troubleshoot the deployment before realising a simple mistake: DigitalOcean required the port to be 8080.
