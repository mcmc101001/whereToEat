\section{Introduction}
I decided to use LaTeX instead of markdown to generate the documentation to brush up on my LaTeX skill.

\section{Tech}
\subsection{Backend}
For the backend, I used FastAPI as the main framework, with Pydantic as the data validation library.

\section{Frontend}
For the frontend, I used Vue.js as the main framework, with TailwindCSS for styling.
